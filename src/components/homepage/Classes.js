        <h1>Cooking Classes</h1>
        <p> Cooking has long been billed as ‘therapeutic’ and a way to de-stress, but a recent study published in the Journal of Positive Psychology has found that cooking and baking can make you feel more relaxed and happier in your everyday life.
        Yet, living in New York leaves little time to cook; when we’re not at work we’re either sleeping or socialising. So why not mix in some socialising with learning new ways to cook? The more cooking skills you gain, the more you will enjoy it and make time for it – so grab some friends (or go solo) and register for my classes below. </p>
